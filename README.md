# Cmple #
A code preprocessor/generator for C++ cross-platform projects.

This utility transforms simplified C++ source code files into fully-functional code units ready for compilation including linking graphical API (such as OpenGL) and related submodules.

### Why this name ###
Comes from "C" and "Simple"

Graphical features are supported for windows creation, basic rendering, input processing.

## Project requirements ##
### Glossary ###
Term | Description
---- | -----------
File converter | A program that converts code written in simplified language to C++ code.
Wrapper | A tool that converts signature of function written in simplified language to syntactically correct C++ function.
Dependency | A relationship of types or objects, between different files
Toolchain | A set of programs used one after another to produce a final program out of code files.
Visibility | A space in code, where a variable or type can be accessed.
Resolver | A function that gives access to objects through a specific identifier.

### Stakeholders ###
Name | Duty | Roles | Responsibilities
---- | ---- | ----- | ----------------
Igor Parfenov | Main developer | Programmer, debugger, testing | Write code, debug code, test code
Anton Dospekhov | Product Manager | Programmer, QA engineer | Write code, check other platforms compatibility, delivery management, user experience design, documentation, git repository management

### User stories ###
Title | Story
----- | -----
C++ file converter | As a developer, I want to be able to write simple script code, so the program converts my simple source files into complete C++ files
Check syntax correctness | As a developer, I want to be able to be sure that input code has correct syntax, so the compiler would get valid files to compile.
Function wrapper | As a developer, I want my functions to have consistent signatures, so the wrapper should check declaration and naming rules.
Class wrapper | As a developer, I want my classes to have consistent structure, so the wrapper should check the interface of the declared class.
Dependency manager | As a developer, I want all libraries and modules to be imported automatically, so the program would create and manage required header files.
Toolchain manager | As a developer, I want to automate compilation of code, after successful processing, so the tool would call the compiler tool chain with required arguments.
Visibility resolver | As a developer, I want the system to automatically manage access to the code interface, so the system would put appropriate access specifiers automatically.
Memory management system | As a developer, I donâ€™t want to manually manage memory and resources, so the system would inject simplified automatic memory allocation and release utility.

### Non-functional requirement ###
Category | Requirement | Actions to achieve
-------- | ----------- | ------------------
Performance Efficiency | Resource Utilization | Create the system to manage memory and keep track of the memory allocations and deallocations for objects of classes.
Usability | Learnability | Create a manual and example file.
Usability | User error protection | Write a delegator that would pass input to the syntax checking tool to ensure primary correctness.
Compatibility | Interoperability | The utility will be a console application, so it would be platform independent.
Maintainability | Testability | We will include an option to enable debugging symbols.

## Features ##
- C++ file converter: program converts simple source files into complete C++ files
- Syntax correctness check.
- Function wrapper: The wrapper checks declaration and naming rules.
- Class wrapper: The wrapper checks the interface of the declared class.
- Dependency manager: All libraries and modules to be imported automatically, so the program creates and manages required header files.
- Toolchain manager: tool calls the compiler toolchain with required arguments.
- Visibility resolver: The system automatically manages access to the code interface.
- Memory management system: The system injects simplified automatic memory allocation and release utility.

## Repository structure ##
Cmple project is implemented in C++. The directory structure follows universal CMake pattern:

	/Build          Binary & Intermediate files (by CMake)
    /Core		    Cmple source code
        /Include    Header public files
        /Source     Source code private files
	/ThirdParty 	Third-party libraries
	/Tests		    Test subproject
	/Examples	    Example project inputs & outputs


## Getting Started ##

### Quick Start: Windows ###

Prerequisites:
- Windows 10 or newer
- Git version 2.22 or newer
- CMake version 3.15 or newer
- C++ build environment as one of:
    - Visual Studio 2019 with all following options:
        - Desktop Development for C++
        - C++ CMake tools for Windows
        - Test Adapter for Google Test (for tests)
        - C++ Clang tools for Windows (optional)
        - LLVM suite for ClangCL builds (optional)
    - MingGW64
        - LLVM suite for Clang builds (optional)

First, download the repository with the following command:
```
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/TonyDecvA180XN/Cmple <where_to_clone>
```
It will grab all included libraries with it. However, if you already cloned it without recursive mode, you can download required modules by running `Install.bat` script.

Every time you need to change compiler suite or your project structure is messed up, use `Clean-Project.bat`

Build process relies on CMake, so make sure all your desired compile environment are visible to it. You can check available generators by running `cmake --help` and examining the trailing section.

To build the project you need run appropriate batch script, as for Windows, one of the:
- `Build-Windows-Clang.bat` for Clang compiler with MinGW build system
- `Build-Windows-ClangCL.bat` for Clang compiler with Microsoft Build system
- `Build-Windows-GCC.bat` for MinGW compiler
- `Build-Windows-MSVC.bat` for Microsoft Visual C++ compiler

First build takes a lot time since it has to build all the libraries included in project.

By default, tests are built with the project, to disable it change in `CMakeLists.txt` in the root folder the following line:
```
set(ENABLE_TESTS ON CACHE BOOL "Build tests" FORCE)
```
to
```
set(ENABLE_TESTS OFF CACHE BOOL "Build tests" FORCE)
```

All executable are stored inside `Build/` folder. Main executable is in `Build/Core/` (or in `Build/Core/Debug/` if you used "MSVC" compiler).
Test executable is in `Build/Tests/` (or in `Build/Tests/Debug/` if you used "MSVC" compiler).

Visual Studio automatically grabs test 

### Quick Start: Unix ###

Prerequisites:
- Git version 2.22 or newer
- CMake version 3.15 or newer
- GCC version 8 or newer
- LLVM for Clang builds (optional)

First, download the repository with the following command:
```
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/TonyDecvA180XN/Cmple <where_to_clone>
```
It will grab all included libraries with it. However, if you already cloned it without recursive mode, you can download required modules by running `bash Install.sh` script.

Every time you need to change compiler suite or your project structure is messed up, use `bash Clean-Project.sh`

Build process relies on CMake, so make sure all your desired compile environment are visible to it. You can check available generators by running `cmake --help` and examining the trailing section.

To build the project you need run appropriate batch script, as for Unix, one of the:
- `Build-Linux-Clang.bat` for Clang compiler with GCC build system
- `Build-Linux-GCC.bat` for GCC compiler

First build takes a lot time since it has to build all the libraries included in project.

By default, tests are built with the project, to disable it change in `CMakeLists.txt` in the root folder the following line:
```
set(ENABLE_TESTS ON CACHE BOOL "Build tests" FORCE)
```
to
```
set(ENABLE_TESTS OFF CACHE BOOL "Build tests" FORCE)
```

All executable are stored inside `Build/` folder. Main executable is in `Build/Core/`.
Test executable is in `Build/Tests/`.

### Code analysis ###
During development the latest/safest modern C++ techniques were used. To ensure For C++ code analysis in this project several linters (static code analysis tools):
- JetBrains Resharper++ Code Inspection
![Resharper CA Settings](Docs/resharper-filter.png)
![Resharper CA](Docs/resharper.png)
- PVS-Studio
![PVS-Studio](Docs/pvs-studio.png)
- Microsoft Visual C++ Code Analysis Tool (with Recommended Native C++ Ruleset)
![MSVC CA](Docs/msvc-ca.png)
- Clang-Tidy as part of LLVM
![Clang-Tidy](Docs/clang-tidy.png)

### Testing ###
Testing is performed using GTest library. We test by feeding test input to the tool and comparing it with the expected output.
